- 👋 Hi, I’m @TRiggAtGM
- 👀 I’m interested in a great many things. Hiking, running, biking, and music are probably the big categories
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about better journaling practices, note making habits, and knowledge sharing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff
- 📫 How to reach me ... Uh... I'm genuinely not sure I want to be posting all that in a repo about me
